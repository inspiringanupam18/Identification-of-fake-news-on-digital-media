# Identification-of-fake-news-on-digital-media
Digital media has become the new go-to source for news consumption. Itâ€™s easy, convenient, and
perfectly suits the on-the-go lifestyle that most people have nowadays.But the comfort comes at a
price, as people, especially the young ones, become very susceptible to half-truths or even
absolutely false news propagated with the intention of spreading misinformation.Hence,
detecting false and unreliable news has recently become an emerging topic of research that is
attracting tremendous attention.
In this project, the proposed system aims to identify fake news efficiently that may help put an
end to the spread of misinformation online. A dataset containing 26000 news articles from
around the globe has been collected.The news articles are then preprocessed by using several
preprocessing techniques. The Doc2Vec model is used for feature vector extraction. The
performance of several classification algorithms is evaluated and is compared at the end.
