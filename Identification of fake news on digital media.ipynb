    "# Identification of Fake News: A Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "Abstract: Digital media has become the new go-to source for news consumption. It’s easy, convenient, and perfectly suits the on-the-go lifestyle that most people have now a days.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the comfort comes at a price, as people, especially the young ones become very susceptible to half-truths or even absolutely false news propagated with an intention of spreading misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, identifying false and unreliable news has recently become an emerging topic of research that is attracting tremendous attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with this project is to develop a reliable model that classifies a given news article as either fake or true."

    "# Introduction:\n",
    "Fake news is defined as news spreading completely false information with an intention to manipulate or scam the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study conducted in 2018 regarding the spread of true and false news online concludes that “lies spread faster than the truth”, stating that fake news proliferates 6 times faster and reaches 10 times larger audience than the real ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information bias as well as the rapid spread of fake news pose a great threat to the reader and are becoming a powerful weapon for gaining peoples’ attention and playing with their emotions. “Fake news” was even named the word of the year by the Macquarie dictionary in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we present an approach for identifying fake news efficiently that may help cease the spread of misinformation across all digital platforms."

    "# Probelm Definition:¶\n",
    "As increasingly a major amount of our day to day lives is spent interacting online through social media platforms, more and more people tend to seek out and consume news from digital media rather than traditional news organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, being the most convenient way of providing news online, it also aids in the dissemination of large volumes of fake news i.e., news articles with intentional false information, which are produced online for a variety of purposes, such as financial and political gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a readily available tool to identify false, agenda-driven news concocted by mixing misinformation with inadequate intention is the need of the hour. This is exactly what the proposed system aims to achieve."

    "# Solution Strategy:\n",
    "(i) Collection of dataset: The dataset contains various news articles from around the world along with the title of the news article and its author.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Data preprocessing: In this step, various preprocessing methods were applied, and the data was made usable in the required context.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) The preprocessed data was fed into the “Doc2Vec” model with some user given parameters, which performs word embedding. Here, the texts were converted into their respective vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv) Training of various models: The idea was to train a couple of classification models with the above data. The models include Naïve Bayes and SVM. Also, a neural network-based model was trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "(v) Cross validation: After successfully training the models, those were to be tested on the unseen test data. In this proposed system, the whole dataset was split in the ratio 80:20 using the hold out method. The training data represents the 80% of the complete dataset and the testing was be done on the remaining 20%."
